This means that when someone tries to access a file in this folder, the app will serve it directly.

The URL path '/uploads/images' is the base URL for accessing files in this folder.
For example, if a file is uploaded with the name 'image.jpg', it can be accessed at 'http://localhost:5000/uploads/images/image.jpg'.
